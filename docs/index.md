# Welcome

Just setting this up , so proper content coming soon :-)

Probably no one reading this but if there is , what im working on ...

- need to adjust the mkdocs styling and navigation, add a few plugins etc 
- need to expand the terraform ive used to depoy the Azure Static Web App this is hosted on to include/ handle the custom domain name config Ive added
- need to document the entire config in the github repo well 
- probably add branch protection rules so that only pull requests can be used to commit. There is already a github action in place that will handle deployments based on that and close the PR


.... oh yeah, and write some content
